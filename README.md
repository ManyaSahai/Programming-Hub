## Introduction

Welcome to the Programming Hub project repository! This project aims to simplify the process of discovering high-quality educational resources for learning programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java. With the vast array of online materials available, it can be overwhelming to choose the right ones. This app provides curated recommendations tailored to users' preferences, including language, format preference (articles, videos, online courses), and difficulty level.

## Project Overview

The project consists of a Streamlit web application that dynamically generates recommendations based on user-selected filters. These filters include the programming language (Python, C++, Java), preferred format (articles, videos, online courses), and difficulty level (beginner, medium, advanced). The app utilizes a modular structure, with separate functions for filtering resources for each programming language.

## Technologies Used

-   Python: The backend logic of the application is written in Python.
-   Streamlit: Programming Hub is built using Streamlit, a powerful Python library for creating web applications.
